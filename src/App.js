                    <p>
                    Kolakucoa is an animated show, created by three young Vancouverites with a bit of the extra spare 
                    time needed to create a cartoon.  After teaming up with some great local talent, we bring you the 
                    result: a young marine biologist travels to the worldâ€™s only island where the animals talk back.  
                    Joined by a sassy turtle, a happy-go-lucky lifeguard, and his pugnacious seal sidekick, our 
                    heroine sets out on the adventure of a lifetime.
